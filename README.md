> **A pure-terminal TensorBoard viewer — with an AI assistant built in.**

Watch your **live training curves right inside any terminal** — locally or SSH'd
into a remote box — and **chat with your runs** in plain English. Scalars, text,
histograms (heatmap **or** distribution bands), PR curves and an HParams table,
drawn as crisp Unicode/braille. **No browser, no X11, no port forwarding.**

![terminalboard demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dongfangyixi/terminalboard/main/demo.gif)

The usual remote-TensorBoard dance is `ssh -L 6006:…` + a browser, or giving up
and `grep`-ing the logs. terminalboard reads the event files directly and draws
them in the terminal — a plain SSH session is all you need (and it's just as
nice **locally**).

## Install

```bash
pip install terminalboard            # one small dependency (plotext); Python 3.9+
terminalboard path/to/tb_logs        # live dashboard in any terminal

# remote training box? just SSH in first — no port forwarding needed:
#   ssh remote
#   terminalboard path/to/tb_logs
```

Or run it without installing: `uvx terminalboard <logdir>` (or `pipx run
terminalboard <logdir>`).

**Optional extras:**

| Extra | Install | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| `[tb]` | `pip install 'terminalboard[tb]'` | the `--tb` parser (official `tensorboard` `EventAccumulator`) |
| `[llm]` | `pip install 'terminalboard[llm]'` | the [AI assistant](#ai-assistant) (any provider via LiteLLM) |

<details>
<summary>Try it without your own logs · install from source</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dongfangyixi/terminalboard.git
cd terminalboard
pip install -e '.[tb,llm,dev]'        # editable, with all extras + test tools
python examples/gen_demo_logs.py      # writes ./demo_logs/ (3 runs, every type)
terminalboard demo_logs
```
</details>

## Highlights

- 📈 **Every TensorBoard type, as terminal text** — scalar curves, text
  summaries, histograms (heatmap **or** distribution bands), PR curves, and a
  runs × hyperparameters **HParams table**.
- 🔍 **Built for comparison** — multi-experiment overlay with stable colors,
  smoothing, log-Y, step↔time, zoom, a powerful tag/experiment filter grammar,
  and a drill-down detail view with a value cursor.
- 🤖 **AI assistant** (`a`) — a multi-session chat (sidebar or full-screen) that
  sees your live view + all log data, **answers questions and operates the
  dashboard** for you, with any LLM provider. Opt-in, audited, privacy-conscious.
- 🪶 **Light by default** — the default install is one small dependency
  (`plotext`) and a self-contained pure-Python event parser; `tensorboard` and
  `litellm` are optional extras.
- ✨ **Smooth TUI** — flicker-free repaints (alternate screen + synchronized
  output), live tailing, per-logdir saved view state, a config file, CSV export.

## Usage

```
terminalboard LOGDIR [options]

  LOGDIR / --logdir   directory of TensorBoard event files (scanned recursively)
  --tb                parse with the tensorboard library (needs [tb]); the
                      built-in pure-Python parser is the default
  --tags GLOB         filter tags, e.g. 'train/*loss*,val/*' (live-editable: t)
  --experiments GLOB  filter experiments/runs (live-editable: f)
  --smooth ALPHA      EMA smoothing weight in [0,1) (default: 0.6; 0 disables)
  --grid RxC          panels per page (default: 2x3)
  --interval SECONDS  live refresh interval (default: 2.0)
  --once              render a single frame and exit
  --list              list all tags and exit
```

```bash
terminalboard logs                       # live dashboard
terminalboard logs --tags 'train/*loss*' # filter to loss curves
terminalboard logs --grid 2x2            # 4 panels per page
terminalboard logs --once                # one frame and exit (good for CI/cron)
```

## Plot types

A page can mix any of these — each panel adapts to its tag's kind:

- **Scalars** — line/braille curves (multiple experiments overlaid).
- **Text** summaries — the latest text shown in a panel.
- **Histograms** — a **heatmap** over steps, or **distribution bands**
  (percentiles over steps) with `b`.
- **PR curves** — precision-vs-recall curves (`pr_curves` plugin).
- **HParams** — a full-screen runs × hyperparameters × metrics **table** (`P`).

### Controls (live mode)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| arrows | move the focused panel (wraps across pages) |
| `Enter` | **inspect** the focused panel full-screen |
| `n` / `space`, `p` | next / previous page of tags |
| `t` / `f` | edit the **tag** / **experiment** filter live |
| `c` | **type selector** — cycle all / scalars / histograms / text / pr-curves |
| `o` | cycle which overlapping curve is on top (z-order) |
| `z` / `Z` | zoom out / in — panels per page: `1·2·4·6·9·12·16·24·36` |
| `b` | histograms ↔ **distribution** bands |
| `+` / `-` / `0` | more / less / no smoothing |
| `x` / `l` | x-axis step↔time / toggle log-Y (scalars) |
| `w` | export the focused scalar tag to a CSV |
| `P` | **HParams** table · `a` chat assistant · `r` refresh · `H` help |
| `q` / `Esc` | quit |

<details>
<summary>Detail view, filter syntax & line-editing keys</summary>

**Detail view** (after `Enter`): a single tag full-screen; **`Esc`** returns to
the grid. By type:

- **scalars** overlay all experiments with a **cursor** — `←/→` move it one point
  (`Shift+←/→` fast), and a per-experiment **value / smoothed / step / wall-time**
  readout updates beneath the plot. `x`/`l` change axis/scale.
- **histograms** show one experiment as a heatmap (`←/→` switches; `b` toggles
  distribution bands).
- **pr-curves** overlay all experiments; `←/→` steps through training.
- **text** is scrollable (`↑/↓`, `PgUp/PgDn`, `Home/End`), `←/→` switch
  experiment, and **`d`** shows a **config diff** — only the keys that differ.

**Filter syntax** (tags and experiments):

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `word` | case-insensitive **substring** (`loss` → `train/loss`) |
| `a b` | **AND** — both must match |
| `a \| b` , `a , b` | **OR** — either matches |
| `* ? [ ]` | glob wildcards (`train/*loss*`) |
| `!word` | **NOT** — a **global exclude** (applies to the whole filter) |
| `/regex/` | regular expression (case-insensitive, unanchored) |

A `!word` excludes **globally** no matter where it sits, so
`a \| b \| c !d` means *(a or b or c) and not d*. It's a small glob + boolean DSL,
**not** full regex: a bare word is a *substring* (`.` is literal). For real regex
use `/.../`; if it needs `|` or spaces, make the **whole** filter the regex, e.g.
`/^train\/(loss|lr)$/`. Filters re-apply as you type; a no-match keeps the current
plots and shows a red warning.

**In any input prompt:** `←/→` move · `↑/↓` history · `Home/End` (or `^A`/`^E`) ·
`^W` delete word · `^K` kill-to-end · `^U` clear · `Alt/Ctrl+←/→` word motion ·
`Enter` apply · `Esc` cancel.

**Multiple experiments:** curves are overlaid per panel, each run in its own
**stable** color (it keeps that color no matter what you filter), with a legend
of **full run names**. Use `f` / `--experiments` to focus a subset.

## AI assistant

> Optional — `pip install 'terminalboard[llm]'`.

Press **`a`** to open a chat with your runs. The model both **drives the
dashboard** (filter, pick a type, smooth, zoom, open a tag, open HParams…) **and
analyzes** your results — in one turn. For example:

- *"show only validation losses, smoothed"* → applies the filter + smoothing
- *"which run is overfitting?"* → a short train-vs-val comparison
- *"open the pr curve and tell me if it's good"* → opens it and gives a verdict

It's a **multi-session chat** — sidebar (the dashboard re-tiles beside it) or
full-screen (`^F`). It sees your **live view** (focused/visible tags, counts,
mode) plus all log data, **streams** the answer with light markdown, and keeps
sessions per-logdir (`/new`, `/next`, `/rename`, …; `Esc` closes). Actions are a
fixed, typed **whitelist** — it can't run shell or touch files.

Powered by **[LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)**, so **any provider
works**. On first use a setup form lets you **search a model** (type `deepseek`,
`qwen`, `claude`, `gpt`… → `↑/↓` + Enter, or type any custom/self-hosted string)
and enter the matching API key. A **small/cheap model is plenty** here:

| Model string | Key | API base |
|---|---|---|
| `gpt-5.4-nano` / `gpt-5.4-mini` | OpenAI | *(blank)* |
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` | Anthropic | *(blank)* |
| `gemini/gemini-3.5-flash` | Google | *(blank)* |
| `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` | DeepSeek | *(blank)* |
| `openrouter/qwen/qwen3.6-35b-a3b` | OpenRouter | *(blank)* |
| `hosted_vllm/Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` | *(your server)* | `http://host:8000/v1` |
| `ollama/llama3` | *(none, local)* | *(blank)* |

(API base stays blank for hosted providers; set it only for your own
OpenAI-compatible server — vLLM, Ollama, Azure…)

> ⚠️ **Privacy:** queries send your **tag names + metric summaries** to the chosen
> provider, and tag names can leak architecture details. If that matters, use a
> **local model** (`ollama/...`) so nothing leaves your machine. The feature is
> **off until you configure it**, and your API key is stored locally
> (`~/.local/state/terminalboard/llm.json`, `chmod 600`).

<details>
<summary>Security audit (we reviewed the pinned LiteLLM from source)</summary>

For the **pinned** LiteLLM (`1.88.1`), reviewed from source: your API key is sent
**only** to the provider endpoint you configured (auth header); there is **no
telemetry** (the flag exists but nothing reads it; logging callbacks default to
empty); and the single non-provider call — fetching a public pricing JSON from
GitHub at import — is **disabled** by terminalboard
(`LITELLM_LOCAL_MODEL_COST_MAP=true`; only the `$`-estimate may lag price
changes). The extra is **version-pinned**, so what you install is what was
audited; we re-audit before bumping it.
</details>

## Configuration

Set defaults in `~/.config/terminalboard.toml` (or `$TERMINALBOARD_CONFIG`); CLI
flags override them. Needs Python 3.11+ (`tomllib`) or `tomli`.

```toml
[terminalboard]
smooth = 0.6
grid = "2x3"
xaxis = "step"     # or "time"
logy = false
tags = "train/*"
# experiments = "baseline | scaling"
# csv_dir = "~/tb-exports"   # pre-filled folder in the CSV (w) save prompt
# restore = true             # save/restore per-logdir view state (default: on)
```

Your filters, zoom, smoothing, axis, order and focus are **saved per-logdir** on
quit and restored next time (under `$XDG_STATE_HOME`, default `~/.local/state`).
Explicit CLI flags win; `--reset-view` starts fresh; `restore = false` disables it.

## Design

1. **Read** the event files (`events.out.tfevents.*`), scanned recursively for
   multiple runs, into a typed series model.
2. **Render** the selected tags as Unicode/braille text — curves, text panels,
   histogram heatmaps/bands, PR curves — tiled into a grid that fits the terminal.
3. **Watch** the logdir and re-render when new data lands. Repaints are
   **flicker-free** (alternate screen buffer + synchronized output, DEC 2026) and
   an idle dashboard isn't repainted at all.
4. **Ask** (optional): the assistant gets a compact summary of your current view
   + log data, replies in the chat, and turns natural language into the same typed
   actions the keys drive.

**Two parsing backends:** the default is a self-contained pure-Python
TFRecord + protobuf-wire parser (tiny install, fast startup, ideal for a thin
remote box). `--tb` uses the official `tensorboard` `EventAccumulator` instead
(needs `[tb]`; falls back to the built-in parser with a note if absent).

<details>
<summary>Why Python (and not a web app)?</summary>

TensorBoard logs are a TF-specific TFRecord/protobuf format with first-class
**Python** tooling, and Python has mature **terminal-plotting** libraries
(`plotext`) — so the whole thing is pure text with no browser or image protocol
needed. A Next.js/TypeScript build would mean hand-reimplementing the TFRecord +
protobuf decoding and have no native terminal-plotting story; its core value
(React/SSR/browser) goes unused for a terminal CLI.
</details>

## Roadmap

**Done:** pure-Python + `--tb` parsers · scalars, text, histograms
(heatmap/distribution), PR curves, HParams table · multi-experiment overlay,
zoom, drill-down cursor, filter grammar · log-Y, step↔time, config diff, CSV
export, config file + saved view state · **AI chat assistant** (any provider,
searchable model picker) · published to
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/terminalboard/).

**Next:** assistant pull-tools agent loop (reads data on demand) · redaction mode
for sensitive tag names · a non-interactive `--analyze` report.
